This is just a temporary fork of http://www.longfocus.com/firefox/gmanager/

Sadly, the source code of the gmail-manager plugin isn't on github and the plugin update cycles are quite slow.

As Mozilla introduced the fantastic quick release cycles for Firefox we need an up-to-date gmail-manager plugin.

You can zip the source code yourself if you don't trust anybody else or use the pre-packed xpi under: https://github.com/tomondev/gmail-manager/tree/master/target
(to install it from github download the xpi per raw view and open the file in Firefox)

I still haven't reached the original author of the gmail-manager plugin, so please excuse my brevity to upload these small changes here.
